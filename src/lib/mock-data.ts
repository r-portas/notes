    content: `Another routine day aboard the Enterprise. The crew performs admirably, our mission proceeds without incident, and my morning coffee was adequate. Though I could swear the canister seemed lighter than usual. Perhaps the replicator is experiencing minor calibration issues. I've made a note to have Scotty examine it when he has a moment between warp core diagnostics.

The coffee blend I've programmed is a careful mixture of Earth's finest Colombian beans with a hint of Vulcan spice leaf—a combination that took me years to perfect. It's one of the small pleasures that makes command bearable in the vastness of space.

When I questioned the computer about unauthorized replicator usage in my quarters, it reported no activity. Either we have a malfunction, or someone has found a way to circumvent the security protocols.

I've changed my access codes as a precautionary measure. Spock raised an eyebrow when I mentioned it during our morning briefing, but offered no comment. His restraint is suspicious. That calculating Vulcan mind is always three steps ahead, isn't it? Always has to be the smartest one in the room.

    content: `The coffee thief strikes again! I measured precisely 2.3 kilograms of my premium blend yesterday evening, and this morning found only 1.9 kilograms remaining. That's 400 grams—enough for at least twenty cups of my perfectly calibrated morning ritual.

Without my usual caffeine intake, I find myself... unfocused. Irritable. The crew's incompetence seems more pronounced today. Even simple tasks require multiple explanations.

I've begun carrying a tricorder to scan for traces of Colombian-Vulcan blend throughout the ship. So far, no conclusive evidence, though I did detect faint aromatic readings near the turbolift on deck seven. The investigation continues, and I have my suspicions about our pointy-eared science officer. He's always so smug, so superior. Maybe it's time someone knocked him down a peg.

    content: `The conspiracy deepens, and my patience wears thin. I've installed micro-sensors around my personal replicator and sealed my quarters with a level-seven security lockout. Yet somehow—impossibly—my coffee reserves continue to diminish.

My head pounds constantly now. Sleep eludes me. But clarity comes with the pain—I see Spock's game clearly now. He thinks he can manipulate me, prove his intellectual superiority by stealing what I hold dear. Well, two can play at that game.

During today's senior staff meeting, I watched him carefully. Those cold, calculating eyes. That insufferable logic. He mentioned our "fascinating" encounter with the Gorn as if it were some academic exercise. I wanted to wipe that smug expression off his green-blooded face.

I've decided to bring Scotty into my confidence. At least he's loyal, honest. A man I can trust.

Scotty understands the severity of this situation—he knows what happens when someone undermines a captain's authority. Together, we've installed additional surveillance equipment throughout the ship, focusing on areas where Spock frequents.

My hands shake slightly as I record this log. The caffeine withdrawal is affecting my motor control, but my mind has never been sharper. I see the patterns now, the web of deceit Spock has woven around my crew. He's probably been reporting back to Starfleet about my "fitness for command." Well, I'll show him who's truly fit to captain this vessel.

Scotty mentioned some interesting readings from the warp core—unusual harmonic frequencies that could mask the sound of someone moving through the ship's corridors. Ingenious. That's why I trust the man.

    content: `Victory is within my grasp! Scotty's surveillance equipment detected movement in the engineering sections during the night shift. Someone has been accessing restricted areas, using advanced knowledge of ship systems to avoid detection. It has to be Spock—who else would have the arrogance to think he could outsmart me?

I find myself fantasizing about the confrontation. The look on his face when I expose his treachery in front of the entire crew. Perhaps a court martial. Maybe even... an accident during our next away mission. No, no—that's beneath a Starfleet captain. But the thought is satisfying.

My vision blurs occasionally now, and I've developed a persistent twitch in my left eye. McCoy would say it's stress, but I know better. It's clarity. Pure, undiluted clarity.

    content: `Something is wrong. Terribly, horribly wrong. I followed Scotty to engineering tonight, expecting to catch Spock in the act of his coffee-thieving conspiracy. Instead, I discovered my trusted chief engineer in the bowels of the warp core chamber, surrounded by burning candles, arcane symbols chalked on the deck plates, and... my coffee.

My precious Colombian-Vulcan blend was being poured into some kind of ritualistic circle around the dilithium matrix. Scotty was chanting in what sounded like ancient Gaelic, hands raised to the warp core as if it were some kind of technological deity.

When he noticed me, he didn't even have the decency to look embarrassed. "Ah, Captain," he said, as casually as if we were discussing duty rosters. "The old gods require proper offerings if we want maximum efficiency from the warp drive."

This isn't the first time Scotty has attempted to improve warp efficiency through occult means. There was the incident with the blessed dilithium crystals, the hex he placed on the antimatter containment unit, and that unfortunate business with the séance in the jefferies tubes.

    content: `I've managed to convince Scotty that my coffee blend is far too precious, too refined, too perfect to be offered as a sacrifice to his Celtic engineering spirits. "Scotty," I told him, "the old gods appreciate quality, but they also understand value. My Colombian-Vulcan blend represents years of careful calibration, a perfect harmony of Earth and alien flavors. Surely beings of cosmic wisdom would prefer a more... common offering?"

He seemed to consider this seriously, stroking his beard as he examined the ritualistic setup around the warp core. "Aye, Captain, you make a fair point. Perhaps standard replicator coffee would suffice for the wee beasties that keep our engines running smooth."

I've agreed to supply him with industrial-grade coffee substitute for his... engineering rituals... in exchange for the return of my personal blend. It's a compromise I can live with, especially since the warp drive efficiency has improved by 2.3% since his supernatural interventions began.

My hands have stopped shaking, and the headaches are subsiding as I gradually reintroduce caffeine to my system. Perhaps I owe Spock an apology for my suspicions, though his smug superiority still grates on my nerves.

    content: `Order has been restored to the universe. My coffee supply is secure, Scotty's occult engineering practices are contained to non-premium beverages, and the Enterprise runs smoother than ever. I've learned valuable lessons about trust, paranoia, and the dangerous effects of caffeine withdrawal on command decisions.

Though I must admit, there's something oddly comforting about having a chief engineer who's willing to commune with ancient spirits to improve our warp drive efficiency. In the vast darkness of space, perhaps we need all the supernatural assistance we can get.

Spock approached me this morning with a raised eyebrow and what might have been concern. "Captain, your recent behavior patterns suggested significant psychological stress. Are you feeling better now that your... coffee crisis... has been resolved?"

Damn his perceptive nature. Even when I was losing my mind with paranoid suspicion, he was watching out for my wellbeing. Perhaps his intellectual superiority isn't such a threat after all—it's what makes him an invaluable first officer.

I've decided to share my perfect coffee blend with the senior staff, though Scotty's portion will be clearly marked "NOT FOR RITUAL USE."

Also, apologize to Spock for the suspicious glares and paranoid questioning. A captain's pride is a dangerous thing when combined with caffeine withdrawal.

The universe is vast and full of mysteries, but sometimes the simplest explanations involve Scottish engineers and their supernatural approach to starship maintenance. At least my coffee is safe.

End log.
